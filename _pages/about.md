Hi, I'm Jules. I'm a Computational Cognitive Scientist. I am interested in the Cultural Evolution of Language & Cognition. I am currently working on a project investigating the interaction between communicative and developmental pressures in typological systems and how these pressures influence the cultural evolution of languages & social cognition. I'm also interested in the formal analysis of models and theories in cognitive science, embodied cognitive science, the cognition of narrativity, the philosophy of cognitive science, information theory and bayesian statistics.

I formally studied Cognitive Science (MSc, The University of Edinburgh), Computer Science (BSc, Sorbonne University) and Literature & Linguistics (BA, Sorbonne University).

In addition to my research interests, I spend a lot of time working on artistic and literary projects with other people in a collective we founded in 2019.
